# GOM-API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MirzaFaizan/gom-api.svg?branch=master&style=for-the-badge)](https://travis-ci.org/MirzaFaizan/gom-api) [![iris](https://img.shields.io/badge/iris-powered-2196f3.svg?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/kataras/iris)

This is a base go lang API with CURD operations with MongoDB

  - Layered folder structure
  - Different Packages

### Tech

This API uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [Golang] - evented operations for the backend
* [Iris-go] - fast Golang network app framework [iris-go.com]
* [mongo-go] - mongoDB official drivers for Golang

### Installation

This API requires [Golang](https://golang.org/) v1.11+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd gom-api
$ go get -u
$ go app.go
```

### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

This API uses Rizla for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

```sh
cd gom-api
go build app.go
```
This will create the executeable GO file and pull in the necessary dependencies.

I am using Rizla Hot Reloading package (which hot reloads the server on code changes) map the port to whatever you wish on your host or set a PORT on your .env file.

```sh
rizla app.go
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8080
```
